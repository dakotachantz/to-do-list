# Build a todo list

Using Express and an in-memory data structure, build a real todo list application.

Use Express to build a todo list application. In order to keep the list of todos, you will need to create some data structure and update it from Express. 

You should be able to add new todos and mark todos as complete. Your application might look like this mockup.
